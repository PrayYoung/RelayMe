# Project State

## Status

v0.1 public-release hygiene audit complete.

## Completed

- Reviewed the supplied v0.1 implementation brief.
- Confirmed the workspace was empty; selected a minimal Python standard-library and SQLite design.
- Validated `list_hosts`, `host_status`, `process_list`, `read_logs`, `read_file`, and `git_diff` through RelayMe on a real host.
- Verified Agent-side `read_file` rejects an outside-root path.
- Corrected `host_status` to report elapsed uptime rather than boot time.
- Added bounded exponential-backoff recovery for temporary Controller/network failures without re-enrollment.
- Validated automatic Agent recovery after a Controller restart, followed by a successful `git_diff` task.
- Replaced tracked deployment identifiers with generic examples and rewrote Git history for public release.

## Current work

- v0.1 is ready for public release. Deployment runtime secrets and host configuration remain outside Git.

## Next action

- Publish the sanitized repository from its new public-release history.
